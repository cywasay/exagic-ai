      answer:
        "SRO is the AI SEO discipline that improves the probability of your content being cited by AI models once retrieved. It addresses the gap between being retrieved and being selected — optimizing content clarity, entity precision, and structural accessibility to increase citation rate.",
    },
    {
      question: "How is SRO different from AEO?",
      answer:
        "AEO optimizes for getting your content into the set of sources AI retrieves for relevant queries. SRO optimizes the selection decision once your content is in that set. AEO gets you retrieved. SRO gets you chosen. Both are necessary for full AI visibility.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does SRO take to show results for industrial brands?",
      answer:
        "Initial selection rate improvements typically appear within 30–60 days of content and snippet optimization. Sustained improvement across a competitive query set develops over 3–6 months as optimization cycles compound and AI retrieval behavior updates to reflect content changes.",

        Being found is not the same as being chosen. We see this in our audits
        every week. An AI system retrieves five manufacturers for a buyer query,
        but it only cites one in the final answer. SRO is the work that makes
        you the one it cites. It is the difference between being a candidate and
        being the winner.

      <h2>What Is Selection Rate?</h2>
      <p>
        It is a simple math problem: (Times Cited / Times Retrieved) &times;
        100. We call this the Selection Rate. If an AI retrieves your site 1,000
        times but only cites you 20 times, your rate is 2%.
      </p>
      <p>
        That is a failure of content structure, not domain authority. In
        traditional search, you want clicks. In AI search, the AI model is the
        only user that matters. It browses your content and decides if you are
        trustworthy enough to name. If your data is fragmented, your selection
        rate stays near zero.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Does Selection Rate Matter for Industrial Manufacturers?</h2>
      <p>
        In the Bay Area, a single procurement contract can be worth $2 million.
        A buyer asks an AI for "titanium flanges in San Jose." The AI finds your
        site. It also finds three others.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your site structure is messy, the AI skips you. It does not want to
        risk being wrong. It chooses the competitor with the cleaner data table.
        We have seen brands with fewer backlinks win more citations just by
        fixing their HTML hierarchy. In AI search, structure beats popularity.
      </p>

      <h2>How Exagic AI Optimizes Selection Rate</h2>
      <p>
        Our process starts with a Retrieval Audit. We use tools to see exactly
        what snippets GPT-4o and Perplexity are pulling from your site. We often
        find they are pulling the wrong paragraphs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, we use Snippet Engineering. We rewrite the content blocks the AI
        is already looking at. We inject precise numbers and material specs
        where they are most visible to the crawler. We turn your paragraphs into
        "extraction traps."
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, we use Entity Reinforcement. We use schema markup to prove the
        relationship between your brand and your location. This gives the AI
        confidence. It stops guessing and starts citing.
      </p>

      <h2>What Results Can Industrial Brands Expect?</h2>
      <p>
        SRO is not an overnight fix. It takes time for models to update their
        knowledge. But we see measurable jumps in citation frequency within 30
        to 60 days.
      </p>
      <p>
        We recently saw a client move from a 5% selection rate to over 40% in
        two months. They didn't build new links. They just updated 12 core pages
        to be machine-readable. That is the power of optimizing for the answer,
        not just the search.
