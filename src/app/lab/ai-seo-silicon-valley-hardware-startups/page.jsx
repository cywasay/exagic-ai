        Hardware is hard, but getting found shouldn't be. In Silicon Valley, we
        have seen that the most innovative startups are often buried under the
        legacy websites of companies that haven't updated their code since 2005.
        But the game has changed. Procurement teams are moving toward AI agents.
        If your competitor's catalog is a 50-page PDF and your specs are in
        clean HTML, you win.
      </p>

      <h2>The Startup Advantage in AI Sourcing</h2>
      <p>
        Startups in San Jose and across the Peninsula are building the future of
        robotics and EVs. But they face a wall of legacy SEO. Big manufacturers
        have thousands of backlinks and decades of history.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, these legacy giants have websites that are structurally
        obsolete. Their data is trapped in PDFs and old formatting. We've found
        that AI models often prefer scanning a nimble startup's site because it
        is cheaper to process. You don't need a million backlinks to beat a
        monopoly; you just need to be machine-readable.
      </p>

      <h2>How Startups Win with AEO</h2>
      <p>
        Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) is your shortcut. We suggest moving
        away from keyword stuffing and toward semantic clarity.
      </p>
      <ul className="space-y-4">
        <li>
          <strong>Physics over Keywords:</strong> Don't just say &quot;Custom
          San Jose Sensors.&quot; Build a map that explains the physics of your
          product and its interface specs. We've seen startups beat industry
          giants just by publishing spec sheets in Markdown instead of a glossy
          brochure. AI loves simple text.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Clean Repositories:</strong> Publish developer docs and API
          guides as simple text. AI agents heavily scrape standard formats over
          bloated marketing pages. If a machine can't parse your data in
          milliseconds, it will skip you for a competitor who is easier to read.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Dominating the Local Knowledge Graph</h2>
      <p>
        Silicon Valley is a hyper-local supply chain. When a factory in Fremont
        needs an emergency part from Santa Clara, the AI looks for proximity and
        trust.
      </p>
      <p>
        We recently saw a local hardware shop triple its B2B leads by wrapping
        its location data in proper schema. Explicitly binding your
        manufacturing to specific Bay Area coordinates tells the machine where
        you are and what you can build. Check your "Specifications" page today.
        If your technical data is trapped in an image or a PDF, rewrite it as a
        simple HTML table.
