      question: "What is the difference between AEO and SEO?",
      answer:
        "SEO optimizes content to rank in search engine results pages. AEO optimizes content to be cited inside AI-generated answers. SEO targets Google's ranking algorithm. AEO targets how AI language models retrieve, evaluate, and cite content when generating answers. Both disciplines share the same technical foundation but require different content and schema strategies.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "Should SF Bay Area industrial companies prioritize SEO or AEO?",
      answer:
        "Both are necessary. SEO provides the technical foundation — crawlable, indexed, authoritative content — that AI retrieval systems depend on. AEO adds the entity precision, direct-answer structure, and schema signals that convert well-optimized traditional content into AI-citable content. For most industrial brands, fixing SEO fundamentals first and then applying AEO on top produces the best results.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does AEO take to show results compared to SEO?",
      answer:
        "AEO typically shows measurable improvements in AI citation frequency faster than traditional SEO shows ranking improvements. Initial citation improvements can appear within 4–8 weeks of content restructuring and schema implementation. Traditional SEO improvements to competitive queries often take 6–12 months or longer. This makes AEO a high-priority investment for industrial brands seeking faster visibility gains.",

        SEO stabilizes your rank in a list of results. AEO makes you the answer
        inside an AI response. We have found that you need both, but they are
        not the same thing. In the Bay Area industrial market, the gap between
        the two is where most leads are currently being lost.

      <p>
        Traditional SEO targets an algorithm that likes popularity and clicks.
        AEO targets a retrieval engine that likes factual density and precise
        specs.

        If your page is popular but vague, it might rank on Google but will fail
        in ChatGPT. We have seen this countless times in our technical audits.
        The AI sees your site, but it cannot find the specific data it needs to
        confidently cite you.
      </p>

      <h2>Do You Need Both?</h2>
      <p>
        Yes. You cannot have AEO without a solid SEO foundation. If your site is
        not indexed, it will not be retrieved. SEO gets you into the library.
        AEO ensures the librarian actually picks up your book and reads from it.
      </p>
      <p>
        We often see pages ranking #3 on Google for "Santa Clara machining" that
        never appear in a Perplexity answer. This is usually because the content
        is written for a human glancing at a page, not a machine analyzing a
        snippet.
      </p>

      <h2>Where SEO Ends and AEO Begins</h2>
      <p>
        SEO handles the table stakes: page speed, mobile-friendliness, and site
        architecture. This is the handoff point. Once the machine can crawl your
        site, AEO takes over to make the data inside those pages "citable."
      </p>
      <p>
        The speed of results is a major difference. Traditional SEO for
        competitive keywords can take 6–12 months. We see AEO improvements—like
        moving from zero to dominant citation share—in as little as 4–8 weeks.
