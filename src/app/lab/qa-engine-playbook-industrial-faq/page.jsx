        In the old days, FAQ pages were where content went to die. In the age of
        AI, they are your best lead generators. We have seen that AI assistants
        rely heavily on Question-Answer pairs to build their responses. If you
        provide the direct answer, the machine will provide the citation.
      </p>

      <h2>Language Models Feed on Question-Answer Pairs</h2>
      <p>
        AI models like ChatGPT and Gemini are trained on conversation. When a
        buyer at an East Bay biotech firm asks about &quot;medical-grade
        titanium machining,&quot; the AI isn't looking for your homepage. It's
        looking for a high-confidence answer to that specific question.
      </p>
      <p>
        In our experiments, we found that sites with clear FAQ schema get cited
        2.5x more often than those with just block text. It makes sense: it's
        easier for the machine to parse a direct pair than to dig through a
        sprawling technical page. You are essentially spoon-feeding the model
        what it needs to be right.
      </p>

      <h2>Building a QA Engine for Industrial Firms</h2>
      <p>
        A good Q&amp;A engine answers the exact technical questions your buyers
        are asking today. We suggest moving away from generic &quot;How do I
        pay?&quot; questions and toward the hard data.
      </p>
      <ul className="space-y-4">
        <li>
          <strong>Tolerances and Specs:</strong> List your exact material
          constraints. If you can't hold a certain tolerance, say it. The
          machine values honesty and precision over marketing fluff.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Supply Chain Geography:</strong> Answer the friction questions
          first. &quot;Can you ship to South SF in 24 hours?&quot; is a search
          entity that buyers care about.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Comparisons:</strong> AI is built for comparing. If you
          explain why CNC routing is better than laser cutting for a specific
          material, the AI will use your logic as the &quot;expert&quot;
          opinion.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Selection Rate Optimization (SRO) Factor</h2>
      <p>
        SRO is the math of getting picked. When an AI agent looks at five
        different suppliers, it chooses the one that is the easiest to cite.
      </p>
      <p>
        We've seen that one well-formatted FAQ page can move you from the bottom
        of the list to the primary source. Stop treating your knowledge as a
        secret. Extract it from your PDFs and turn it into plain text Q&amp;A.
      </p>
      <p>
        Check your site today. If your best technical answers are buried in a
        paragraph on page five, move them to a dedicated FAQ page and add
        schema. It is the fastest way to start winning the AI procurement war.
