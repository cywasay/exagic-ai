              How Do Different AI Platforms Handle Industrial Search Queries?
            </h2>
            <p className="mt-6 text-xl font-medium text-zinc-900 leading-relaxed">
              ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and Perplexity each use different
              mechanisms to retrieve and cite sources. Effective AI SEO requires
              understanding and optimizing for each platform's specific
              behavior.

                <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed">
                  Gemini retrieves shallow context—typically just the query
                  string, the URL, the title, and a short snippet of
                  approximately 150–300 characters. This means the first 150
                  words of any industrial capabilities page carry
                  disproportionate weight. Optimization for Gemini prioritizes
                  complete, contextually rich answers in the opening paragraph
                  of every page, alongside high-fidelity structured data that
                  enables Gemini's agents to precisely extract your technical
                  specs for sourcing answers.

                <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed">
                  ChatGPT's grounding architecture relies heavily on web
                  retrieval (Search), making traditional SEO fundamentals—like
                  crawlability, semantic content structure, and authoritative
                  signals—directly relevant to AI visibility. Content must be
                  highly discoverable and formatted for clear information
                  extraction. Since ChatGPT's search functionality uses the Bing
                  index, Bing SEO optimization is a strategic requirement
                  alongside Google-focused efforts to ensure visibility in GPT
                  interfaces.

                  Perplexity provides explicit citations with every single
                  answer, making its source selection highly transparent.
                  Optimization requires becoming a cited authoritative source
                  through comprehensive, well-researched content that includes
                  clear attribution signals. Perplexity prioritizes fresh,
                  real-time information—making content recency and regular
                  technical updates particularly important for industrial
                  suppliers who want to be cited in market intelligence and
                  supplier comparison queries.
