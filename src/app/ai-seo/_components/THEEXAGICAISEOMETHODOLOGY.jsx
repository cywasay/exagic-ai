              Our methodology is built on direct experimentation with language

              process designed specifically for industrial manufacturers and B2B
              suppliers.

                  Phase 1 — Brand Knowledge Analysis
                </h3>
                <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed">
                  What do AI models currently believe about your brand? We begin
                  by systematically probing models across ChatGPT, Gemini, and
                  Perplexity to map how your brand, products, and services are
                  currently represented. This diagnostic phase identifies weak
                  associations where a model fails to connect you to your
                  product categories, missing entity connections that make you
                  invisible in local San Francisco industrial searches, and
                  inaccurate descriptions that require immediate correction.

                  Phase 2 — Entity and Association Mapping
                </h3>
                <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed">
                  Language models understand the world through entities and
                  their interrelationships. In this phase, we map your core
                  entities—your brand name, specific product lines, and key
                  technical capabilities. We then build associations between
                  your brand and high-authority industry categories, regional
                  suppliers in the East Bay, and critical technical
                  specifications. We proactively bridge "entity gaps"—those
                  connections that should exist but are currently weak in the
                  model's internal weights.

                  Phase 3 — Citation Analysis
                </h3>
                <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed">
                  When AI systems generate grounded answers, they retrieve and
                  cite specific sources. We analyze which domains and content
                  formats AI platforms currently select for queries in the
                  industrial manufacturing niche. By identifying the current
                  "citation stack," we can pinpoint where your brand has the
                  opportunity to displace competitors and which specific content
                  structures (such as technical specifications or case studies)
                  the models prefer to extract.

                  Phase 4 — Grounding Prediction
                </h3>
                <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed">
                  Not every query triggers AI to retrieve external sources; some
                  queries are answered purely from training data. We use
                  proprietary testing to identify which queries in your
                  industrial niche trigger "grounding" behavior in Google,
                  ChatGPT, and Perplexity. This allows us to focus optimization
                  effort exclusively on queries where content strategy and
                  technical grounding can actually influence the AI's output,
                  maximizing your ROI.

                  With full diagnostic data in place, we execute targeted
                  on-page and off-page optimization. This includes content
                  restructuring for entity clarity, semantic completeness
                  improvements to cover informational gaps, and heavy technical
                  data structuring—converting your PDF catalogs and complex spec
                  sheets into AI-readable JSON-LD. We ensure your brand's data
                  is present on the authoritative sources that AI platforms
                  trust most for technical grounding.

                <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed">
                  Tracking success in the AI era requires a new set of metrics.
                  While we keep an eye on traditional SERP performance, our
                  primary focus is AI visibility tracking. We measure the
                  frequency of your brand citations, the accuracy of brand
                  mentions, the strength of entity associations, and your total
                  share of citations compared to competitors across the major
                  frontier models—providing a monthly heartbeat of your brand's
                  AI influence.
